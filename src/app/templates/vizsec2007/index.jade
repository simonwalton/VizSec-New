      p <strong>Visalert: From Idea to Product</strong>
      p <a href=''>slides</a>
      p Visalert is a visualization system designed to increase situational awareness and increased analysis abilities for monitoring network events: it enables to access data from multiple databases, correlate who, what, when and where, and zoom in-out information of interest. This presentation will describe the interdisciplinary user centered process to research, design and develop a technology to meet user needs. This includes direct examples and lessons learned interacting with the domain experts and users, the visual design iterations that evolved in the final metaphor, and the issues to consider in the process of evaluating and transfering technology to the end users.

      p <strong>The Real Work of Information Assurance Analysts</strong>
      p <a href=''>slides</a>
      p This talk will cover three of the findings of a cognitive task analysis (CTA) of computer network defense (CND) analysts: 1) the hierarchy of data that is transformed through the analytical process from data into security situational awareness; 2) the definition and description of different roles of CND analysis; and 3) the workflow that analysts and analytical organizations engage in to process raw network data into meaningful security incidents. These CTA findings have implications for designing visualizations to improve the work processes and decision making of CND analysts. The findings also guided the design and development of VIAssist, a visual analytics system developed for and under evaluation by the CND community.

        h2 Call for Papers
      p The VizSec 2007 Workshop on Visualization for Computer Security will provide a forum for new research in visualization for computer security. Building on the success of the previous three VizSEC workshops, we will again be meeting in conjunction with the IEEE Vis and InfoVis Conferences. The workshop will be held in Sacramento, CA USA on October 29, 2007.
      p Networked computers are increasingly ubiquitous, and they are subject to attack, misuse, and abuse. Every effort is being made by organizations and individuals to build and maintain trustworthy computing systems. Traditional, signature-based and statistical methods are limited in their capability to cope with the large, evolving data and the dynamic nature of Internet. In many applications, visualization proves very effective to understand large high-dimensional data. Thus, there is a growing interest in the development of visualization methods as alternative or complementary solutions to the pressing cyber security problems.
      p As a result of previous VizSec workshops, we have seen both the application of existing visualization techniques to security problems and the development of novel security visualization approaches. However, while security visualization research has addressed the development of applications there has only been limited coverage of user needs and designing visualization to support those needs. To address this shortcoming, the theme of this year's workshop will be on applying user-centered design to VizSec research, focusing on integrating users' needs, visualization design, and evaluation. This year's workshop will be an incubator for new ideas related to security visualization, a forum for garnering feedback from peers, and a place to identify and meet potential collaborators.

      h3 Technical Papers
      p We solicit papers that report results on visualization techniques and systems in solving all aspects of cyber security problems. Topics include, but are not limited to:
      ul
        li Visualization of Internet routing for security
        li Visualization of packet traces and network flows for security
        li Visualization of security vulnerabilities and attack paths
