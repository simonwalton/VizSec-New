      h3 Keynote Speaker
      h4 Bill Cheswick, AT&amp;T Labs
      p <strong>Visual Tools for Security: Is there a there there?</strong>
      p It seems obvious: networks, software, authentication, and people have important and often complicated relationships and interactions. There's far too much going on to keep track of all of it, but we know there are important devils down in the details.  We know they are there.
      p Though many have been chasing this dream of security visualization for a couple of decades, we don't have that much to show for our efforts. We use NOCs and tools widely for managing large networks, but they get complicated fast.  And most of the anomalous activity is weird but benign, leaving us awash in a sea of false positives.  And those people in the NOCs seem totally resistant to 3D displays,  data gloves,and other cool tools of our trade.
      p What can we do?  How can we help, really?
      p <a href="http://cheswick.com/ches/">Bill Cheswick</a> is interested in security that's too hard to ensure, passwords that are too hard to remember, graphs that are too hard to visualize, and VCRs that are too hard to program. And lots of other stuff. Ches is an early innovator in Internet security. He is known for his work in firewalls, proxies, and Internet mapping at Bell Labs and Lumeta Corp. He is best known for the book he co-authored with Steve Bellovin and now Avi Rubin, Firewalls and Internet Security; Repelling the Wily Hacker. Ches is now a member of the technical staff at AT&amp;T Labs - Research in Florham Park, NJ, where he is working on security, visualization, user interfaces, and a variety of other things.

        h2 Call for Papers
      p The <strong>6th International Workshop on Visualization for Cyber Security</strong> is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners in information visualization and security to address the specific needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization techniques. Co-located this year with <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2009/">IEEE VisWeek 2009</a>, VizSec will continue to provide opportunities for the two communities to collaborate and share insights into providing solutions for security needs through visualization approaches. Accepted papers will be published by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> and archived in the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp">IEEE Digital Library</a>. The authors of the best papers will be invited to extend and revise their paper for journal publication in a special issue of <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ivs/">Information Visualization</a>.
      p This year our focus is on advancing Visualization for Cyber Security as a <strong>scientific discipline</strong>. While art, engineering, and intuitions regarding the human element will always remain important if we are to obtain useful cyber security visualizations, advances in the scientific practice of research are needed. The scientific aspects of visualization for cyber security draw both on empirical observation (similar to many natural and social sciences) and formal science (such as the formal derivations in mathematics). Barriers confronting current researchers include concerns about available data, lack of a common agreement about what constitutes sound experimental design, the difficulties of measuring the relative effectiveness of security visualizations in practice, and the lack of a common understanding of user requirements. While many researchers are making progress in these and other critical areas, much work yet remains.

      h3 Technical Papers
      p Papers offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present technique, applications, practical experience, theory, or experiments and evaluations. Papers are encouraged on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons from actual application. We encourage papers that report results on visualization techniques and systems in solving all aspects of cyber security problems, including how visualization applies to:
      ul
        li Different aspects of security: software, networks and log files (e.g., Internet routing, packet traces and network flows, intrusion detection alerts, attack graphs, application security, etc.) 
        li Application of visualization techniques in formalizing, defining and analyzing security policies 
        li Forensic analysis, correlating events, cyber-defense task analysis 
        li Computer network defense training and offensive information operations  
        li Building rules, feature selection, and detecting anomalous activity 
        li Software, software security, and viruses 
        li Deployment and field testing of VizSec systems 
        li Evaluation and user testing of VizSec systems 
        li User and design requirements for VizSec systems 
        li Lessons learned from development and deployment of VizSec systems 
        li Field Research Best Practices 
        li Interaction with domain experts - best practices, lessons learned 
        li Differentiating the needs of different domains and time frames 
        li Best practices for obtaining and sharing potentially sensitive data for purposes of visualization and assessment, including how to approach personal privacy, regulatory, and organizational issues 
        li Metrics and measurements (e.g., criteria for the relative effectiveness of cyber visualizations) 
        li Handling large datasets, scalability issues, and providing real time or near-real time visualizations 
      p Please consider using public data sets to demonstrate your VizSec system. Using public data sets makes it easier to compare VizSec systems. One example comes from this year's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/VASTchallenge09/">VAST Challenge 2009</a>: An employee is leaking important information to the outside world.
