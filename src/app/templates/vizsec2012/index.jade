        h2 Call for Papers
      p The International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization techniques. Co-located this year with VisWeek, the 9th VizSec will provide new opportunities for the usability and visualization communities to collaborate and share insights on a broad range of security-related topics. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.
      p Important research problems often lie at the intersection of disparate domains. Our focus is to explore effective, scalable visual interfaces for security domains, where visualization may provide a distinct benefit, including computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, preventing 'user assisted' attacks, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing in addition to traditional network security. Human time and attention are precious resources. We are particularly interested in visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture human analyst insights so that further processing may be handled by machines, freeing the analyst for other tasks. For example, a malware analyst might use a visualization system to analyze a new piece of malicious software and then facilitate generating a signature for future machine processing. When appropriate, research that incorporates multiple data sources, such as network packet captures, firewall rule sets and logs, DNS logs, web server logs, and/or intrusion detection system logs, is particularly desirable.

      h3 Technical Papers
      p Full papers offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, practical experience, theory, analysis, or experiments and evaluations. We encourage papers on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving cyber security practices, including but not limited to:
      ul
        li Situational awareness / understanding
        li Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response
        li Computer forensics
        li Recording and reporting results of investigation
        li Reverse engineering and malware analysis
        li Privacy
        li Multiple data source analysis
        li Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense
        li Evaluation / User testing of VizSec systems
        li Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)
        li Modeling system and network behavior
        li Modeling attacker and defender behavior
        li Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks
        li Predicting future attacks or targets
        li Security metrics and education
        li Lessons learned
      p Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library two weeks prior to the conference. The program committee will select an accepted paper to receive the VizSec Best Paper award. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper.
      
      h3 Awards
      p There will be an award for the best paper from the accepted program. The best paper award will be given to the paper judged to have the highest overall quality. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper. This award will be chosen by the program committee.
      
      h3 Data
      p If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at, and perhaps submitting an entry, for this year's <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2012">VAST Challenge</a>. 
      p <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/index.php">Last year's challenge</a> also had cybersecurity data if you are looking for additional data.
